To use download_data2.py:

You need to initialize all config parameters in 'main' specifying the dataset, the root path, and the city you want ('chicago', 'stlouis', 'lacity'). Then you need to download the corresponding city_area.txt file and city_bbox.txt file and specify their locations in 'main'. Finally you can download the data.
